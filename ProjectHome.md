Your company is under developing. All new system is web enabled.
It is necessary  to have a central authenticate system.
But [JOSSO](http://www.josso.org/) or [CAS](http://www.jasig.org/cas) are too heavy and hard to customized. That is why oisso wrote.

Oisso is not a product, it just a semi-finished software,
For example, you want to authenticate user by LDAP,
You wanna a change password page, attach a logo into login page ...

Yes, it's all your business. Oisso only make thing simply.

Oisso is a maven project base on  [openid4java](http://code.google.com/p/openid4java/) and [spring security](http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/)

Build the projects and deploy them to see how they are running.<br />
I hope it is helpful.
